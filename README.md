# np-playtime
<b>A simple FiveM script that tracks the playtime of each player and saves it in config. (Standalone)</b>

I'll appreciate it if you will give me a star in this repo. ⭐⭐⭐

# 🪄  What's best in this script from other scripts? 🪄

> This script doesn't use any operating system commands to know when the player joins/left the game.

> This script doesn't need any assistance from any framework to save the data players. The script saves it to a JSON file.

> This script has an API that shows all data players in common. (*You can connect it to **Discord Bot** and fetch all the data players and know who the most online player is on your server!*)
